### Figuring out Reflection and Transmission Coefficients:

We want to first characterize the first mirror by measuring it's transmission and reflection coefficients. We can do this by directly measuring the incident beam intensity, reflected beam intensity and transmitted beam intensity using a power meter.




![Reflection Transmission Setup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akshivbansal/phys408OpticalCavity/master/Figures/ReflectionTransmissionSetup.png) 

For the first mirror, the angle was set to also Incident for $M_2$): 
$(0.262 \pm 0.001)$ mW 
Input incident to $M_1$: 
$(18.00 \pm 0.01 )$ mW
Reflection from $M_1$: 
$(7.23 \pm 0.01)$ mW 

This part is slightly trickier we had to orient the second mirror so that the reflected spot was far enough from the incident so that we could measure it separately.  We also had to move on of the other mirrors in the setup so we retook the incident beam measurement for $M_2$. 

Incident for $M_2$:
$(0.345 \pm 0.005)$ mW 
Transmission for $M_2$:
$(1.05 \pm 0.05) \mu$ W 
Reflection for $M_2$:
$(0.338 \pm 0.005)$  mW


Reversed $M_1$
Incident Beam:
$18.08 \pm 0.05$ mW
Transmission:
$(0.200 \pm 0.001 )$ mW
Reflected:
$(16.34 \pm 0.02)$ mW
Reason for losses in this case: we had to reflect it off an additional mirror in order to take this measurement. We find the power loss of this additional mirror
Power before Additional Mirror
$(19.51 \pm 0.01)$ mW
 Loss of about 1.5 mW into $M_1$ 
 Then out of the $M_1$ another loss of 1.5
 Now we can calculate the finesse with cavity length L = 15cm and wave number k = 
 $$I = \frac{I_{max}}{1 + \frac{2\mathscr{F}}{\pi}^2\sin^2(kL)} \implies \mathscr{F} = \sqrt{\frac{\pi(\frac{I_{max}}{I} - 1)}{2\sin^2(kL)}}$$
 $$\mathscr{F} = $$
