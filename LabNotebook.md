Figuring out Reflection and Transmission Coefficients:
We want to first characterize the 
Transmission for M1: 
(Also Incident for M2)
$(0.262 \pm 0.001)$ mW 
Input incident to M1: 
$(18.00 \pm 0.01 )$ mW
Reflection from M1 
$(7.23 \pm 0.01) mW $
This part is slightly trickier we had to orient the second mirror so that the reflected spot was far enough from the 
Transmission for M2
$ ( )mW $
Reflection for M2
