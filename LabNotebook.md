Figuring out Reflection and Transmission Coefficients:
We want to first characterize the 
Transmission for M1: 
(Also Incident for M2)
$(0.262 \pm 0.001)$ mW 
Input incident to M1: 
$(18.00 \pm 0.01 )$ mW
Reflection from M1 
$(7.23 \pm 0.01)$ mW 
This part is slightly trickier we had to orient the second mirror so that the reflected spot was far enough from the incident so that we could mesure it sperately. 
Transmission for M2
$( 1.05 \pm 0.05) \mu $ W
