Figuring out Reflection and Transmission Coefficients:
We want to first characterize the 
Transmission for M1: 
(Also Incident for M2)
$(0.262 \pm 0.001)$ mW 
Input incident to M1: 
$(18.00 \pm 0.01 )$ mW
Reflection from M1 
$(7.23 \pm 0.01)$ mW 
This part is slightly trickier we had to orient the second mirror so that the reflected spot was far enough from the incident so that we could measure it separately.  We also had to move on of the other mirrors in the setup so we retook the $M_2$ measurement data. 
Incident for M2
$(0.345 \pm 0.005)$ mW 
Transmission for $M_2$
$(1.05 \pm 0.05) \mu$ W 
Reflection for $M_2$
0.338 \ 0,005  mW
